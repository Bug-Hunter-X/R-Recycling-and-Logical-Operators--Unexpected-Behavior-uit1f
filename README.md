# R Recycling and Logical Operators: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a potential pitfall in R programming related to recycling rules and logical operators.  When applying logical operations (e.g., &, |) between matrices and vectors, R's automatic recycling can produce results that may deviate from initial expectations.

The `bug.r` file illustrates an example of such unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.r` provides a solution to handle this issue and ensure the code operates as intended.

This scenario is relevant to data analysis where element-wise operations on matrices are crucial. Understanding R's recycling behavior is key to writing robust and error-free R code.
